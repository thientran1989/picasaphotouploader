Picasa Photo Uploader is for android phones. This application will automatically upload the photos you take with the phone's camera to a Picasa webalbum of your choice. Uploads are done in the background.

It was developed with and compiled for android platform 1.5 since that is what my HTC Hero uses. So I have no idea if it works on any other platforms. If any demand I can try to compile for other ones.

Released version 1.1 that implements multipart related uploading which should be a lot more reliable than the raw binary uploading which gave corrupted images sometimes.
